    The Twingate Connector is a lightweight software component that establishes secure connections between your private network and the
    Twingate service. It acts as a bridge, allowing authorized users to access internal resources without exposing them directly to the
    internet. The Connector uses strong encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure that all data transmitted between users and
    resources remains confidential and secure.
