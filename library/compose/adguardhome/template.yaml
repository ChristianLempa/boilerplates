  description: |-
    Network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. AdGuard Home operates as a DNS server that
    re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole", thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers.
    It features advanced DNS filtering, parental controls, safe browsing, and HTTPS/DNS-over-TLS/DNS-over-QUIC support.
    ## Prerequisites
    - :info: During the initial setup, AdGuard Home runs an HTTP server on port 3000 to guide you through configuration.
    **With Traefik enabled:** Access initial setup via container IP at `http://<container-ip>:3000`.
    After setup completes, access the admin interface via the configured domain.
    - :warning: **Security Notice:** The initial setup on port 3000 uses an unencrypted HTTP connection.
    Only use this for initial configuration and disable it (`initial_setup=false`) after setup is complete.
    - :warning: If you require DHCP functionality or want AdGuard Home to bind directly to port 53,
    you must set `network_mode` to `host` or `macvlan`. Note this exposes all container ports directly on the host.
    You can't use `traefik_enabled` in this case!

          Port 3000 is only used during the initial setup wizard when Traefik is disabled.
          With Traefik enabled, access setup via container IP instead.
          After completing setup, AdGuard Home switches to port 80 and port 3000 becomes inactive.
