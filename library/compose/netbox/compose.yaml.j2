  - services/redis.yaml: Redis cache and queue services
  - services/postgres.yaml: PostgreSQL database (Compose mode only)
  - common/networks.yaml: Network definitions
  - common/volumes.yaml: Volume definitions
  - common/secrets.yaml: Secrets (Swarm mode only)
#}
include:
  - services/netbox.yaml
  - services/worker.yaml
  - services/redis.yaml
  {% if not database_external and not swarm_enabled %}
  - services/postgres.yaml
  {% endif %}
  - common/networks.yaml
  - common/volumes.yaml
  {% if swarm_enabled %}
  - common/secrets.yaml
