  description: |
    Open-source telemetry collector and a distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector, designed to gather and process logs, metrics, traces, and profiles from your applications and infrastructure. It integrates features from the OpenTelemetry Collector and Prometheus, offering programmable pipelines with a rich, expression-based syntax and support for multiple observability ecosystems. Alloy functions as a powerful, high-performance, and vendor-neutral tool for observability, acting as a successor to the Grafana Agent and providing enhanced features for scaling and managing telemetry data.
