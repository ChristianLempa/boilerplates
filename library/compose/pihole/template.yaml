    Pi-hole is a network-wide ad blocker that acts as a DNS sinkhole, blocking ads and trackers for all devices on your network.
    It improves browsing speed, enhances privacy, and reduces bandwidth usage by filtering out unwanted content at the DNS level.
    Pi-hole can be easily integrated with existing routers and supports custom blocklists and whitelists.
