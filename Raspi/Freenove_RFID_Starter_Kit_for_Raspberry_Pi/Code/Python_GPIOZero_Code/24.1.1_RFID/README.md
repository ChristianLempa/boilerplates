MFRC522-python
==============

A small class to interface with the NFC reader Module MFRC522 on the Raspberry Pi.

This is a Python port of the example code for the NFC module MF522-AN.

##Requirements
This code requires you to have SPI-Py installed from the following repository:
https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py

##Examples
This repository includes a couple of examples showing how to read, write, and dump data from a chip. They are thoroughly commented, and should be easy to understand.

## Pins

| SDA  | 24    | GPIO8      |
| SCK  | 23    | GPIO11     |
| MOSI | 19    | GPIO10     |
| MISO | 21    | GPIO9      |
| IRQ  | None  | None       |
| GND  | Any   | Any Ground |
| RST  | 22    | GPIO25     |
| 3.3V | 1     | 3V3        |

##Usage
Import the class by importing MFRC522 in the top of your script. For more info see the examples.
