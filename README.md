# Christian's "Boilerplates"

Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Christian, a 35-year-old tech enthusiast from Germany, and I love to inspire and educate people in IT.

This Repository **Boilerplates** is my personal template collection. Here you'll find templates, and configurations for various tools, and technologies. 

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this wonâ€™t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my YouTube Channel: [Christian Lempa](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZNhwA1B5YqiY1nLzmM0ZRg).
