{#
  Archetype: service-environment-v1
  
  Description:
    Sets environment variables directly in the compose file.
  
  Approach:
    - Always includes TZ (timezone) variable
    - Swarm-compatible (env_file doesn't work in Swarm mode)
    - Can be extended with additional environment variables
  
  Usage:
    Use for services that need environment variables set directly.
    This approach works in both standard Docker Compose and Swarm mode.
    
  Notes:
    - For sensitive data in Swarm mode, use secrets instead
    - For many variables in standard mode, consider env_file archetype
