  Archetype: service-basic-v1
  
  Description:
    Basic service definition with image, container name (non-swarm), and hostname.
    This is the foundation for any Docker Compose service.
  
  Approach:
    - Defines the service name and image
    - Conditionally adds container_name only for non-swarm deployments
    - Sets hostname for service identification
  
  Usage:
    Use this as the starting point for any service definition.
